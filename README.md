## Brief description

The Smart Dust Bin project is an innovative IoT solution that combines the power of the ESP32 microcontroller, RIOT OS (Operating System for the Internet of Things), and the AWS (Amazon Web Services) ecosystem. The project aims to create an intelligent waste management system with real-time monitoring, data analysis, and a user-friendly web interface.

## Concept

The core concept behind the project is to create a dust bin that autonomously detects nearby objects and opens its lid automatically. This eliminates the need for manual lid operation, offering a hygienic and convenient experience for users. The ESP32 board serves as the central control unit, efficiently processing sensor data and managing the lid mechanism. Overall, the Smart Dust Bin project combines the ESP32 board, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor and intelligent software to create an advanced waste management system. With automated lid opening, it enhances user convenience, improves waste collection efficiency, and contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable environment other than improving hygenical aspects.

The servo motor is a versatile actuator commonly used in projects requiring precise control of rotational motion. In your project, the servo motor serves the purpose of automatically opening the lid of the smart dust bin. By receiving control signals from the ESP32 board, it can rotate to a specific angle, allowing the lid to open smoothly. The servo motor adds a dynamic and automated functionality to the system, enhancing user experience.

### Mosquitto MQTT-Broker

Mosquitto is an open-source MQTT broker that facilitates lightweight messaging between devices in an IoT project. In this project, Mosquitto is used to enable efficient and secure communication between the smart dust bin and other components, such as the ESP32 board and the web interface, ensuring reliable data transmission and real-time updates.

### AWS Ecosystem
